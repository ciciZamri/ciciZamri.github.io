    <p class="pt-3">
        The Social Dilemma is a documentary film directed by Jeff Orlowski. This film revealed
        that popular social media applications such as Facebook, Twitter and Instagram can be
        very harmful to the mental health of society. All these social media applications have millions
        of active users everyday around the world. It is true that this technology can bring a lot of positive
        impacts on society such as business marketing and long-distance instant message communications but most
        of the users do not realize the opposite side which are the negative effects.
    </p>
    <p>
        In the film, it shows that there are a lot of privacy issues in social media applications. Incident
        of personal information data breaches is not a bug but it is one of the features of the system and this can
        be very disturbing to many users. Every activity or interaction with social media application such as 
        watching videos, sending text messages, and like a friend's photo will be recorded. Then all the activities
        will be analyzed to create personalized experiences that can engage the individuals to use the app longer
        until at some point, the individual became addicted to use the apps. Social media apps also have sophisticated
        recommendation engine that can make the apps more addictive.
    </p>
    <p>
        In conclusion, as a social media application user, we need to use the apps wisely so it can bring more goods than harm to us.
